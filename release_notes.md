### New Features
- Converted pmsm_foc_rolo_pic32_cm_mc to configurable project to generate code with PMSM_FOC component

### Known Issues
* Isolated EDBG Card 
  * The Isolated EDBG Card may appear "grayed out" (disabled) under the list of tools in MPLABX v5.45. In order to resolve this issue, please go to Tools -> Options ->Embedded->Generic Settings and enable "Exclude device checks for kits" by selecting the check box. 
  
  ![Exclude_Device_Checks](apps/docs/images/mchv3/exclude_device_checks_edbg.jpg) 
  
  * Programming or debugging PIC32CM, SAM C/D2x or SAM D/E5x MCU, using Isolated EDBG Card (board revision #02-10824-R1) on dsPICDEM™ MCHV-3 High Voltage Development Board may inhibit MCU from executing instructions if the MCU is reset by pressing on board 'Reset' switch or power cycling the board. Refer to the [Isolated EDBG Debugger Product Change Notice](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/AC320202) for details of hardware modification needed to resolve this issue.

  * If programming failure occurs with message "java.lang.RuntimeException:RDDI_DAP_OPERATION_FAILED", then reset the Isolated EDBG Card's configuration by Go to File -> Project Properties -> EDBG -> Reset 

* For any demos running on PIC32CM MC00 Motor Control PIM, if any failures are observed while trying to use X2CScope, these failures may occur due to shortage of CPU computation bandwidth. In such cases, enable "RAM_EXECUTE" mode which speeds up execution by executing certain functions from RAM memory instead of Flash memory.

### Required MPLAB Harmony v3 Modules
* csp v3.9.1
* x2c v1.1.4
* motor_control v3.7.0
