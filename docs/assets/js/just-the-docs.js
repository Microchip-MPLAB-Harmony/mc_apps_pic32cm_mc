MICROCHIP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$1,000. 12. General. (a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona and the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in Maricopa County, Arizona for any dispute relating to this Agreement. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, this Agreement is subject to the laws of the country in which the Software is downloaded, and, to the extent so mandated by such laws, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in connection with this Agreement. (b) Unless the parties have a mutually executed agreement relating to the licensing of this Software by Microchip to Licensee (\\\"Signed Agreement\\\"), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes and replaces prior or contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or communications between the parties regarding the Software, including any purchase orders. If the parties have a Signed Agreement, this Agreement does not supersede or replace that Signed Agreement. This Agreement will not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (c) Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (d) This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by law or otherwise, without Microchip's prior written consent. Any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization, transfer of all or substantially all assets or other change in control or majority ownership (\\\"Change of Control\\\") is considered an assignment for the purpose of this Section. Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. However, Microchip may assign this Agreement to an affiliate, or to another entity in the event of a Change of Control. (e) Licensee acknowledges its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Agreement would cause Microchip irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be an adequate remedy. Licensee, therefore, agrees if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated any such provisions then Microchip may seek equitable relief, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. (f) Authorized representatives of Microchip shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee's premises and to audit Licensee's records and inventory of Licensee Products, whether located on Licensee's premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's adherence to the terms of this Agreement.

Refer to Application note AN2590 for the ROLO based estimator based sensor-less FOC technique in detail. Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: . | Measure the motor phase currents. | Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. | Measure the rotor position angle. | Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. | The stator current torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. | The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. | Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. | .

    "content": "Brushless Direct Current electric motors, or BLDC motors for short, are electronically commutated motors powered by a DC electric source via an external motor controller. The electronic commutation to rotate the motor is achieved by a three phase inverter. The commutation technique are broadly classified as block Commutation and Sinusoidal commutation. The block commutation has reduced system complexity as compared to the sinusoidal commutation. Hence, the block commutation technique is quite popular for the low cost applications where control precision, reduced efficiency, and higher acoustic noise are permitted. The BLDC motor control using block commutation is done as follows: . | Read the hall sensor input pattern from three 120 degree spatially oriented hall sensor. | Use the hall sensor pattern to determine the three phase inverter commutation pattern. | .

The first part of this section, numerical scaling for fixed-point implementation is briefly described. The later section, the software implementation of the example project is described. Scaling: . The example project uses Q14 format to represent the real-time physical quantities as follows: . The real value range of voltage, current and speed is chosen as independent base quantities for deriving the range of other physical quantities. The independent base quantities are determined by considering the electrical constraints of the MCLV2 development board and the motor used. Software Implementation . Software Configuration . The motor specific parameters, board specific parameters and application parameter macros have to be updated in the software for optimal control of the BLDC motor. The following section briefly describes motor and application specific parameters used in the project. These parameter macros can be found in userparams.h header file which can be found under logical path: Header Files &gt; config &gt; &gt;userparams.h in MPLABX IDE. Setting motor control PWM frequency and dead-time: . PWM frequency is set by configuring the timer period of the TCC0 in terms of TCC0 clock counts. This frequency needs to be communicated to other sections in the algorithm by defining the “Period Value” (set in MPLAB Harmony Configurator) + 1 as a macro in userparams.h. For example, in order to achieve a PWM frequency of 20 KHz in edge aligned mode with peripheral clock frequency of 48MHz, the period value defined in MHC is 2399.

    "content": "The project implements a V/Hz control algorithm on PIC32CM MC 32-bit micro-controller to regulate the speed of the high voltage ACIM motor drive. The following section describes briefly the V/Hz control algorithm, software design, software configuration, and implementation details. The following block diagram shows a typical V/Hz control block diagram. V/Hz control algorithm: . The V/Hz control is a scalar control motor control strategy where the applied ratio of applied AC voltage and frequency is kept constant. The V/Hz control is carried out in the following steps- . | Read the commanded speed request. | Determination of angular displacement per speed loop cycle. | Determination of AC voltage magnitude based on the angular displacement per speed loop cycle. | Determination of PWM modulation values for voltage source inverter. | Application of calculated PWM values to three phases of the ACIM motor. | . Determination of angular displacement per speed loop cycle: . The requested ACIM motor speed is mapped to the angular displacement by using the following relation: . For fixed point implementation, the input speed is scaled from ( 0 , Nrated ) to ( 0 , 214 ) units. From (i) and (ii), we get, . For fixed point implementation, the angle is scaled from ( 0 , 360 o ) to ( 0 , 216 ) units. Thus the final equation becomes: . Determination of AC voltage magnitude for voltage source inverter: . The AC voltage magnitude is determined based on the requested RPM based on following relation: . Determination of PWM modulation values for voltage source inverter: . The calculated voltage magnitude and phase is modulated using SVPWM approach to generate corresponding three phase gate control signals. This PWM modulation approach utilizes third order harmonic injection to increase the inverter DC bus utilization by about 15%. The following diagram shows the typical SVPWM waveform with third order harmonic injection: . Software Design . An interrupt based approach is used for the software implementation. There are three threads: main thread, ADC ISR thread, and a push button ISR thread. The main thread is used to carry out UART based data communication in polling mode. ADC ISR thread is used to carry out the actual V/Hz speed control algorithm. This thread is executed cyclically every PWM period as shown in the following figure: . Push button ISR thread is used to carry out start and stop motor operations. This thread is non-cyclic and is executed once there is an external push button switch event. The following figure shows the activity diagram of threads used in the software: . Software Configuration: . The V/Hz control algorithm can be used to control different ACIM motors. In order to get the correct control of the ACIM motor, the motor specific parameters and application parameters need to be updated in the software. The following section describes how to update both motor and application specific parameters in the the project. These parameter macros can be found in userparams.h header file which can be found under logical path: Header Files &gt; config &gt; &gt;userparams.h. PWM frequency is set by configuring the timer period of the TCC0 in terms of TCC0 clock counts. The period value +1 set using the MHC needs to be redefined as a macro in userparams.h. For example, in order to achieve a PWM frequency of 20 KHz, the period value defined in the MHC is 1199. Therefore, the macro defined in userparams.h should be “period value” + 1 = 1200. | Macro | Description | . | PWM_HPER_TICKS | PWM Timer period value = “Period value” defined in MHC + 1 | . | DEAD_TICKS | Dead-time defined in terms of PWM timer ticks = “Dead time value” defined in MHC | . |   |   | .
