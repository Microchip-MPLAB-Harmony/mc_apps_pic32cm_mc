Refer to Application note AN2590 for the ROLO based estimator based sensor-less FOC technique in detail. Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: . | Measure the motor phase currents. | Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. | Measure the rotor position angle. | Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. | The stator current torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. | The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. | Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. | .

In this state, control waits for the switch press. | Field Alignment: | . Rotor is aligned to known position at D-axis or Q-axis by applying a pre-defined value of the current for a pre-defined length of time. The magnitude of the current and the length of the time for which it is applied depends upon the electrical and mechanical time constant of the PMSM motor drive. Electrical time constant of the motor is a function of R and L values of the motor windings, whereas the mechanical time constant of the motor drive is primarily a function of the static load on the motor shaft. | Open Loop: | . This state is applicable to sensorless position feedback methods. In this state, the speed of the PMSM motor is gradually ramped up using an open loop control. During this mode, the rotor angle is derived from the asserted open loop speed reference. This derived rotor angle would be lagging from the actual rotor angle. The speed is ramped up linearly to a minimum value required for the PLL estimator to estimate the electrical speed of the PMSM motor with sufficient accuracy.

The electronic commutation to rotate the motor is achieved by a three phase inverter. The commutation technique are broadly classified as block Commutation and Sinusoidal commutation. The block commutation has reduced system complexity as compared to the sinusoidal commutation. Hence, the block commutation technique is quite popular for the low cost applications where control precision, reduced efficiency, and higher acoustic noise are permitted. The BLDC motor control using block commutation is done as follows: . | Read the hall sensor input pattern from three 120 degree spatially oriented hall sensor. | Use the hall sensor pattern to determine the three phase inverter commutation pattern. | .

The first part of this section, numerical scaling for fixed-point implementation is briefly described. The later section, the software implementation of the example project is described. Scaling: . The example project uses Q14 format to represent the real-time physical quantities as follows: . The real value range of voltage, current and speed is chosen as independent base quantities for deriving the range of other physical quantities. The independent base quantities are determined by considering the electrical constraints of the MCLV2 development board and the motor used. Software Implementation . Software Configuration . The motor specific parameters, board specific parameters and application parameter macros have to be updated in the software for optimal control of the BLDC motor. The following section briefly describes motor and application specific parameters used in the project. These parameter macros can be found in userparams.h header file which can be found under logical path: Header Files &gt; config &gt; &gt;userparams.h in MPLABX IDE. Setting motor control PWM frequency and dead-time: . PWM frequency is set by configuring the timer period of the TCC0 in terms of TCC0 clock counts. This frequency needs to be communicated to other sections in the algorithm by defining the “Period Value” (set in MPLAB Harmony Configurator) + 1 as a macro in userparams.h. For example, in order to achieve a PWM frequency of 20 KHz in edge aligned mode with peripheral clock frequency of 48MHz, the period value defined in MHC is 2399.

    "content": "The project implements a V/Hz control algorithm on PIC32CM MC 32-bit micro-controller to regulate the speed of the high voltage ACIM motor drive. The following section describes briefly the V/Hz control algorithm, software design, software configuration, and implementation details. The following block diagram shows a typical V/Hz control block diagram. V/Hz control algorithm: . The V/Hz control is a scalar control motor control strategy where the applied ratio of applied AC voltage and frequency is kept constant. The V/Hz control is carried out in the following steps- . | Read the commanded speed request. | Determination of angular displacement per speed loop cycle. | Determination of AC voltage magnitude based on the angular displacement per speed loop cycle. | Determination of PWM modulation values for voltage source inverter. | Application of calculated PWM values to three phases of the ACIM motor. | . Determination of angular displacement per speed loop cycle: . The requested ACIM motor speed is mapped to the angular displacement by using the following relation: . For fixed point implementation, the input speed is scaled from ( 0 , Nrated ) to ( 0 , 214 ) units. From (i) and (ii), we get, . For fixed point implementation, the angle is scaled from ( 0 , 360 o ) to ( 0 , 216 ) units. Thus the final equation becomes: . Determination of AC voltage magnitude for voltage source inverter: . The AC voltage magnitude is determined based on the requested RPM based on following relation: . Determination of PWM modulation values for voltage source inverter: . The calculated voltage magnitude and phase is modulated using SVPWM approach to generate corresponding three phase gate control signals. This PWM modulation approach utilizes third order harmonic injection to increase the inverter DC bus utilization by about 15%. The following diagram shows the typical SVPWM waveform with third order harmonic injection: . Software Design . An interrupt based approach is used for the software implementation. There are three threads: main thread, ADC ISR thread, and a push button ISR thread. The main thread is used to carry out UART based data communication in polling mode. ADC ISR thread is used to carry out the actual V/Hz speed control algorithm. This thread is executed cyclically every PWM period as shown in the following figure: . Push button ISR thread is used to carry out start and stop motor operations. This thread is non-cyclic and is executed once there is an external push button switch event. The following figure shows the activity diagram of threads used in the software: . Software Configuration: . The V/Hz control algorithm can be used to control different ACIM motors. In order to get the correct control of the ACIM motor, the motor specific parameters and application parameters need to be updated in the software. The following section describes how to update both motor and application specific parameters in the the project. These parameter macros can be found in userparams.h header file which can be found under logical path: Header Files &gt; config &gt; &gt;userparams.h. PWM frequency is set by configuring the timer period of the TCC0 in terms of TCC0 clock counts. The period value +1 set using the MHC needs to be redefined as a macro in userparams.h. For example, in order to achieve a PWM frequency of 20 KHz, the period value defined in the MHC is 1199. Therefore, the macro defined in userparams.h should be “period value” + 1 = 1200. | Macro | Description | . | PWM_HPER_TICKS | PWM Timer period value = “Period value” defined in MHC + 1 | . | DEAD_TICKS | Dead-time defined in terms of PWM timer ticks = “Dead time value” defined in MHC | . |   |   | .
